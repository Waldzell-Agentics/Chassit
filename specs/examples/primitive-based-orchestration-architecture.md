# Primitive-Based Orchestration Architecture Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the transformation of existing orchestrations in `src/resources/orchestrations/` into a composable, primitive-based architecture using the four core primitives: Querying, Filtering, Aggregation, and Reasoning. The new architecture enables modular, reusable, and scalable orchestration patterns that can be dynamically composed to meet diverse information retrieval and analysis needs.
