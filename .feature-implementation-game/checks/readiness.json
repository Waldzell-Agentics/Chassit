  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "âœ… Clear user-facing problem & success metrics defined in spec",
    "âœ… MCP server/client API contracts specified (tools, resources, prompts)",
    "âœ… Backward compatibility plan documented (no breaking changes to existing Srcbook)",
    "âœ… Feature flag name defined: feature.ai_agent_notebook_adaptation",
    "âœ… Telemetry events & metrics spec drafted (execution metrics, error tracking)",
    "ðŸ”„ Security & privacy review queued (MCP server authorization, sandboxing)",
    "âœ… Docs outline and examples scope agreed (MCP API docs, integration guides)",
    "âœ… Rollout + rollback plan sketched (flagged rollout with kill switch)"

    "MCP server implementation with stdio and HTTP transports",
    "MCP client implementation with multi-server management",
    "JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol implementation",
    "OAuth 2.1 authorization for HTTP transport",
    "Notebook tool/resource integration",
    "Feature flag integration",
